# Prework Study Guide

## Description

 This project is a study guide of all the material I learned during the prework. I build this project to help further my understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It solves the problem of not having a organized area for me to reference material learned in the prework.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open up the console using Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) it will tell you the topics that were listed and which one you should study at random.
